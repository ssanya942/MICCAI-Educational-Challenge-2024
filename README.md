# Implementing Vision Transformers in PyTorch from Scratch on Any Dataset!
Vision Transformers were introduced in 2020 to present a classification approach for images inspired by the Transformer architecture used prevalently in text classification. They present a robust approach powered by multi-head self-attention to compete with CNNs for image classification/segmentation tasks.
